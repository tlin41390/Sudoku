Hamza Shah

this code will generate a partially empty sudoku board via user input by asking them what to put from 1-9, and then proceed to solve it via backtracking.

Runtime: O(n^m) where n represents the possibilites for each square, and m represents the squares that are empty.

SpaceComplexity: O(n^2) the program is running with a 9^2 board and is using a 2 dimensional array.
